# Fake-News-Prediction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can classify news articles as either "Real" or "Fake." With the rapid spread of misinformation, particularly through online platforms, identifying fake news has become critical. This project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a logistic regression model to analyze textual content from news articles and make predictions about their authenticity.
